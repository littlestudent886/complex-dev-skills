# Task Plan: [Feature / Brief Description]
<!--
  Purpose: Persistent roadmap for a complex feature.
  Update: After each phase, update its **Status** and capture key decisions/errors.
-->

## Goal
[One sentence describing the end state]

## Current Phase
Phase 1

## Phases

### Phase 1: Discovery
- [ ] Restate the request as acceptance criteria
- [ ] Confirm scope + non-goals
- [ ] Capture constraints (compat/perf/time/release)
- **Status:** in_progress

### Phase 2: Codebase Exploration
- [ ] Find similar features and trace implementations
- [ ] Map relevant architecture boundaries and extension points
- [ ] Identify testing/build/lint conventions
- [ ] List key files to read (with file:line when possible)
- **Status:** pending

### Phase 3: Clarifying Questions
- [ ] List all ambiguities and edge cases
- [ ] Ask questions in an organized list
- [ ] Wait for answers / confirm defaults
- **Status:** pending

### Phase 4: Architecture Design
- [ ] Produce 2–3 approaches (minimal / pragmatic / clean)
- [ ] Compare trade-offs (risk/time/testability/maintainability)
- [ ] Recommend one approach
- [ ] Get explicit user choice + approval to implement
- **Status:** pending

### Phase 5: Implementation
- [ ] Implement in small verifiable increments
- [ ] Follow existing codebase patterns
- [ ] Run the smallest relevant validations continuously
- **Status:** pending

### Phase 6: Quality Review
- [ ] Review changes (correctness/security/conventions/simplicity)
- [ ] Report only high-confidence issues (≥80) with fixes
- [ ] Address issues per user decision
- **Status:** pending

### Phase 7: Summary
- [ ] Summarize what was built and key decisions
- [ ] List files modified
- [ ] Provide verification steps
- [ ] Note risks + suggested next steps
- **Status:** pending

## Decisions Made
| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
|          |           |

## Errors Encountered
| Error | Attempt | Resolution |

## Notes
- Read this file before major decisions.
- Update phase status as you progress: pending → in_progress → complete.
- Log all errors and do not repeat the same failing action.
