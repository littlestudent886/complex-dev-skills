# Feature Development (Complex Tasks)

A codebase-agnostic workflow for building new features safely:
- 7 phases (discovery → exploration → questions → architecture → implement → review → summary)
- Persistent planning files for long tasks (so goals and discoveries don’t get lost)

## Inputs

Minimum input:
- A 1–2 sentence feature description (what to build + who/why).

Helpful extras (optional):
- Acceptance criteria / examples
- Related files or modules
- Docs / tickets / prototypes (if inaccessible, ask user to paste key parts)

## Quick Command: Initialize Planning Files

From a Codex chat/session (run from anywhere inside your repo):

```text
$complex-feature-dev init
```

Behavior:
- Runs `scripts/init-session.(sh|ps1)` (creates `task_plan.md`, `findings.md`, `progress.md` if missing; targets git repo root by default)
- Then stops (you can re-run `$complex-feature-dev <feature description>` to start Phase 1)

Hard rule:
- If the user’s request is exactly `init` / `initialize` / `初始化`, run the initializer via the shell tool (Bash on macOS/Linux; PowerShell on Windows) and stop (do not start Phase 1).

## Reference Docs (Richer Guidance)

This skill keeps the core workflow in `SKILL.md`, and ships deeper checklists/prompt templates in:
- `references/complex-feature-dev.md` (full workflow reference)
- `references/code-explorer.md` (Phase 2 checklist)
- `references/code-architect.md` (Phase 4 checklist)
- `references/code-reviewer.md` (Phase 6 checklist)
- `references/examples.md` (example outputs and question style)

## Output Format

At the end of each phase, present results using the output templates in:
- `references/complex-feature-dev.md` → “Phase Outputs”
- `references/examples.md`

Keep user-facing messages structured and scannable (short headings + bullets + file:line where possible). Put deep details into `findings.md` and `progress.md`.

Also:
- Always label the current phase in user-facing output (e.g. `Phase 3: Clarifying Questions`). Use the user’s language when appropriate.
- In **Phase 3**, do **not** talk about starting implementation. Only say you will propose architecture options next (Phase 4), then wait for answers.

## Quick Start (Persistent Planning Files)

**These files live in the project root (not in the skill folder):**
- `task_plan.md` (roadmap + phase status)
- `findings.md` (requirements, discoveries, decisions)
- `progress.md` (chronological log + tests)

This workflow **requires** these files. Do not proceed with Phase 1 until they exist.

Initialize them (defaults to git repo root):
- macOS/Linux (or Windows Git Bash): `bash "${CODEX_HOME:-$HOME/.codex}/skills/complex-feature-dev/scripts/init-session.sh"`
- Windows PowerShell: `pwsh -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "$env:CODEX_HOME\skills\complex-feature-dev\scripts\init-session.ps1"`
  - If `CODEX_HOME` is not set: `pwsh -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "$env:USERPROFILE\.codex\skills\complex-feature-dev\scripts\init-session.ps1"`

Alternatively, you can copy templates manually from this skill’s folder:
- `assets/templates/task_plan.md`
- `assets/templates/findings.md`
- `assets/templates/progress.md`

## Project Guidelines (Codex)

- During exploration, look for `AGENTS.md` and follow instructions (including any nested ones that apply to the files you touch).
- If `AGENTS.md` doesn’t exist, fall back to project docs like `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `README.md`, and existing code conventions.
- Capture the important conventions you discover in `findings.md`.

## Non-Negotiable Rules

1. **Never skip Phase 3 (Clarifying Questions).** If anything is underspecified, ask and **wait**.
2. **Never start Phase 5 (Implementation) without explicit approval.**
3. **Use the planning files as persistent memory.** Update them throughout.
4. **Read before decide.** Before major decisions, re-read `task_plan.md`.
5. **Log all errors + don’t repeat failures.** If an action fails, change the approach.

## How to Track Progress

- Use `update_plan` for the UI checklist (7 steps).
- Use planning files for persistence:
  - After each phase: set `**Status:** pending|in_progress|complete` in `task_plan.md`.
  - After discoveries: write them to `findings.md`.
  - After concrete actions/tests: write them to `progress.md`.

---

## Phase 1: Discovery

**Goal:** Make the request concrete and testable.

- If planning files are missing, run the initializer script via the Bash tool (don’t ask the user to manually copy templates), and do not proceed until the files exist.
- Restate the request as acceptance criteria; confirm scope and non-goals.
- Capture constraints (compatibility, performance, time, rollout).
- Write confirmed requirements + acceptance criteria to `findings.md`.

## Phase 2: Codebase Exploration

**Goal:** Identify the correct integration points and existing patterns.

Use `references/code-explorer.md` as your checklist for each exploration pass.
When presenting Phase 2 results to the user, match the structure in `references/examples.md` (start with “Found similar features:” and “Key files to understand:”).

Do 2–3 independent exploration passes:
- Pass A: find similar features and trace end-to-end
- Pass B: map architecture boundaries and extension points
- Pass C: identify testing/build/lint/config/observability conventions

For each pass:
- record entry points, call chain, and key files (prefer file:line) in `findings.md`.

Also:
- locate and follow `AGENTS.md` instructions (if present).

## Phase 3: Clarifying Questions (Hard Stop)

**Goal:** Resolve all ambiguity before architecture and implementation.

When asking questions, use the Phase 3 style from `references/examples.md`:
- Start with a clear phase label (e.g. `Phase 3: Clarifying Questions`)
- Then “Before designing the architecture, I need to clarify:”
- Then a numbered list
- **Do not mention Phase 5 here**; after answers you move to Phase 4 (architecture options).

Ask questions grouped by:
- behavior definition (inputs/outputs/state)
- edge cases (empty values, duplicates, concurrency, ordering, permissions)
- error handling (timeouts, retries, idempotency, rollback)
- integrations (APIs, data models, config, feature flags)
- backward compatibility & migration
- performance assumptions
- observability
- testing & acceptance plan

Wait for answers (or propose defaults and get explicit confirmation). Record final answers in `findings.md`.

## Phase 4: Architecture Design

**Goal:** Present 2–3 viable approaches and let the user choose.

Use `references/code-architect.md` to structure the blueprint(s).
When presenting options, match the Phase 4 style from `references/examples.md` (Approach 1/2/3 + Pros/Cons + Recommendation + “Which approach would you like to use?”).

Provide at least:
- Minimal changes (reuse, low risk)
- Pragmatic balance (cleaner boundaries)
- Optional clean architecture (more refactor, higher long-term clarity)

For each approach include:
- files to create/modify
- key abstractions + data flow
- trade-offs (risk/time/testability/maintainability)

Write the chosen approach + rationale to `findings.md` and `task_plan.md`.

## Phase 5: Implementation (Requires Approval)

**Goal:** Implement the chosen approach.

- Implement in small verifiable increments.
- Follow existing conventions; avoid unrelated refactors.
- Log actions/files/tests in `progress.md`.
- Log errors in `task_plan.md` (and resolution in `progress.md`).

## Phase 6: Quality Review

**Goal:** Catch high-impact issues before delivery.

Use `references/code-reviewer.md` as the review checklist.
When presenting review results, match the Phase 6 style from `references/examples.md` (“Code Review Results:” + priority buckets + “What would you like to do?”).

Default review scope:
- Prefer reviewing `git diff` (or specified files).

Focus areas:
- correctness, security/permissions, error handling, observability, conventions, simplicity

Confidence filtering:
- score issues 0–100
- **report only issues ≥ 80 confidence**, with concrete fixes (file:line)

## Phase 7: Summary

**Goal:** Deliver a clean handoff.

When presenting the final summary, match the Phase 7 style from `references/examples.md` (“Feature Complete:” + sections).

- Summarize what was built, key decisions, and files modified.
- Provide verification steps (commands/endpoints/UI paths).
- Call out risks and suggested next steps.
