# Examples (Output Style)

These examples are meant to standardize *how* you ask questions and *how* you present phase outputs.

## Phase 2 Example (Codebase Exploration)

```text
Found similar features:
- User authentication (src/auth/): Uses JWT tokens, middleware pattern
- Session management (src/session/): Redis-backed, 24hr expiry
- API security (src/api/middleware/): Rate limiting, CORS

Key files to understand:
- src/auth/AuthService.ts:45 - Core authentication logic
- src/middleware/authMiddleware.ts:12 - Request authentication
- src/config/security.ts:8 - Security configuration
```

## Phase 3 Example (Clarifying Questions)

```text
Phase 3: Clarifying Questions

Before designing the architecture, I need to clarify:

1. Provider: Which providers? (Google, GitHub, custom?)
2. User data: Store provider tokens or just user profile?
3. Existing auth: Replace current auth or add alongside?
4. Sessions: Integrate with existing session management?
5. Error handling: How should failures be surfaced?
```

## Phase 4 Example (Architecture Options)

```text
I've designed 3 approaches:

Approach 1: Minimal Changes
- Extend existing AuthService with OAuth methods
- Add new OAuth routes to existing auth router
- Minimal refactoring required
Pros: Fast, low risk
Cons: Couples OAuth to existing auth, harder to test

Approach 2: Clean Architecture
- New OAuthService with dedicated interface
- Separate OAuth router and middleware
- Refactor AuthService to use common interface
Pros: Clean separation, testable, maintainable
Cons: More files, more refactoring

Approach 3: Pragmatic Balance
- New OAuthProvider abstraction
- Integrate into existing AuthService
- Minimal refactoring, good boundaries
Pros: Balanced complexity and cleanliness
Cons: Some coupling remains

Recommendation: Approach 3 - gives you clean boundaries without excessive refactoring.

Which approach would you like to use?
```

## Phase 6 Example (Quality Review)

```text
Code Review Results:

High Priority Issues:
1. Missing error handling in OAuth callback (src/auth/oauth.ts:67)
2. Memory leak: OAuth state not cleaned up (src/auth/oauth.ts:89)

Medium Priority:
1. Could simplify token refresh logic (src/auth/oauth.ts:120)
2. Consider extracting OAuth config validation

All tests pass. Code follows project conventions.

## Phase 7 Example (Summary)

```text
Feature Complete: OAuth Authentication

What was built:
- OAuth provider abstraction supporting Google and GitHub
- OAuth routes and middleware integrated with existing auth
- Token refresh and session integration
- Error handling for all OAuth flows

Key decisions:
- Used pragmatic approach with OAuthProvider abstraction
- Integrated with existing session management
- Added OAuth state to prevent CSRF

Files modified:
- src/auth/OAuthProvider.ts (new)
- src/auth/AuthService.ts
- src/routes/auth.ts
- src/middleware/authMiddleware.ts

Suggested next steps:
- Add tests for OAuth flows
- Add more OAuth providers (Microsoft, Apple)
- Update documentation
```
